# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

But the real challenge was adding some more script to the existing code so that the election commission could see the following:
- The voter turnout for each county;
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count;
- The county with the highest turnout.
After that we had to print the results to the command line and save them to election_results.txt file.
